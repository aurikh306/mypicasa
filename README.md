Project Title:                  e-DATA ACQUISITION TOOL

DESCRIPTION: 
E-data acquisition tool is a customised windows phone application that retrieves information using existing cloud service with REST API support. The application gives access to image albums that are private, public or shared in Google Picasa. The focus has been to use simple metro UI style, user friendly and efficient UI in demonstrating all features of the application. The MyPicassa application will first asks for authentication from Google and then gets Images data with JSON. The selected album images can then be shown in portrait or landscape mode. It also has option to take a picture using full camera features of device and upload and download images using the google service. The captured images are marked and stored in the ‘Auto Backup’ page of the application. 

AVAILABLE TOOLS AND RESOURCES USED:

Visual studios 2010 express for windows phone
Microsoft Visual studios extensions such as Nuget and simple JSON extensions, Zune software
MSDN tutorials and forums

FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY:

The application complies with the mandatory requirements of the project as set by the course tutor. Project features are implemented as planned before. The Project has:
--Login and logout options
--Application bar 
--User activities interactive with cloud service, GET; POST.
--Tombstoning handling. 
--Windows Phone Navigation 
--Clear UI with tappable support, screen orientation support in portrait and landscape mode
--View one single picture or multiple pictures support
--User can choose to save the password in Isolated storage or to uncheck the save password option
It also has options to download pictures and also to take pictures on site and upload them in MyPicassa to be viewed as a single picture or a collection of images.  

Other features include: 

--localization, for which Resource files are available in finnish
--Model View-ViewModel architecture 
--live tiles support

SCOPE OF PROJECT: 

This project can be further extended for various other third party software used by companies internally. The JSON logic used in the application can be utilized to show connectivity to any database (for e.g. a company’s database) utilizing a REST API support. It can serve as a data acquisition tool using a customised mobile application that is easy access, reliable and efficient. I’m currently working on a project for SITO to make a customised application for their internal software which includes a lot of features of e-acquisition project. This project will go a long way to improve my concepts in mobile applications development and make commercial applications of significance in the growing market.

FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN THE PROJECT:

I would like to further extend the applications bar to include ‘comments’ option for the images that can help me do a similar project that I am currently working on in SITO where uploading images and posting comments is an important feature of application. Further, the pictures and projects documentation can be added or posted based upon their location. Live tile can be customized to show recent projects added to an account for company’s internal software.

RESULTS AND OUTCOME: 

To gain an understanding of important concepts of JSON, user functionality, implementation and design of a specific data model, windows application development tools and their implementation in a work environment. I have learned a lot from this project. It was very useful to learn the important concepts of how to use an API to retrieve information from a database. The e-acquisition project also triggered my lost interest for windows programming, thus making this a very interesting and motivating course.
